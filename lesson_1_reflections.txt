How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was very helpful to do this via the tool! So QUICK and EASY..

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
sometimes adding new lines of code could bring in new bugs. The history will allow me to track these changes. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Having a logical seperation is best done manually than by automated programs. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google doc does not have interdependency among files. Git helps track for multiple code changes that was performed to achieve a logic or a feature. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log provides a complete log of all the commits so i know who, when the description of changes were made
git diff lets me see what changes were made between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
very confident as i can check the changes and go back to them easily using GIT
